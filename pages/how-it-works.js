                  In order to get any program recommended on this web site, all
                  you need to do is follow the 5-step process below.
                </p>
                <h1>
                  <strong>Step 1: Click Add To Cart</strong>
                </h1>
                <p>
                  After watching the video sales page, or reading a written
                  salesletter, an add to cart button will appear. You may need
                  to reload the website for this to appear as sometimes in
                  testing, this is delayed until it is spoken about in the
                  video. Refreshing the website will always make it appear if
                  that is the case.
                </p>
                <h1>
                  <strong>
                    Step 2: Choose if you would like to add on any other offers
                  </strong>
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Occasionally there is an extra order page, where you get
                  offered additional products, then at this stage you can choose
                  if you would like to add this to your order or not.
                </p>
                <h1>
                  <strong>Step 3: Type in your payment information</strong>
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Enter your credit card details and email address, and order
                  the product.
                </p>
                <h1>
                  <strong>Step 4: Select any extra upgrades</strong>
                </h1>
                <p>
                  This is not essential, but you will be shown some extra add
                  ons to your purchase that you may find useful.
                </p>
