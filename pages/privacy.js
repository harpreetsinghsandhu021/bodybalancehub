      <p>
        Posts on this website may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images,
        articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the
        exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These
        websites may obtain information about you, use cookies, embed extra

        our paid advertising.

      <h2>How long we retain your personal information</h2>
      <p>
        If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are stored
        indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow up
        comments automatically instead of keeping them in a moderation queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        For people that register on our site (if any), we also keep the personal
        data they give us in their user profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        All users can see, edit, or erase their personal information at any time
        (except they cannot change their username).
      </p>
      <p>Website admin can also view and update those details.</p>
      <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
      <p>

        data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.
      </p>

        you.

        administrative, legal, or security purposes.
