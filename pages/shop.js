              moving.” —<em>The New York Times</em>

              Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and
              entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s
              developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create
              unique results in both life and business—and which any person or
              organization can adopt to help achieve their goals.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="gp-component-id-xEyo2zyanl">
            In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater
            Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City.
          </p>
          <p class="gp-component-id-vNPoNsBL5">
            Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients
            than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most
            important private company in the United States, according to&nbsp;
            <em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;magazine.
          </p>
          <p class="gp-component-id-1lzgdrKWzu">
            Dalio himself has been named to&nbsp;<em>Time&nbsp;</em>magazine’s
            list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
          </p>
          <p class="gp-component-id-hS4yNYB_ZI">
            Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have
            led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he
            describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful
            work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.”
          </p>
          <p class="gp-component-id-SR5OQ12fBw">
            It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who
            grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island
            neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.

              Everything you believe about how to lose weight is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              Weight gain and obesity are driven by hormones—in everyone—and only by
              understanding the effects of insulin and insulin resistance can we
              achieve lasting weight loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this highly readable and provocative book, Dr. Jason Fung sets out an
              original, robust theory of obesity that provides startling insights into
              proper nutrition.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to his five basic steps, a set of lifelong habits that will
              improve your health and control your insulin levels, Dr. Fung explains
              how to use intermittent fasting to break the cycle of insulin resistance
              and reach a healthy weight—for good.
